# Capita selecta: Reinforcement Learning for Operations Management

This repository contains course materials and resources for the **Capita selecta: Reinforcement Learning for Operations Management** course organized by GP-OML.

### Papers and Presentations

- **Martijn Mes' Presentations:** Papers related to anticipatory scheduling, freight selection, approximate dynamic programming, and patient admission planning
- **Willem Van Jaarsveld's Presentations:** Papers on deep controlled learning, DRL roadmap, travelling maintainer problem, and spare parts balancing
- **Zaharah Bukhsh's Presentations** Will be added after the second session.  

## DynaPlex

In the course, we briefly discussed DynaPlex. The 1.0 version (define MDP in c++) can be found here:

[DynaPlex GitHub Repository](https://github.com/dynaPlex/dynaplex/)

The API for the 2.0 version is complete - the software itself is being finalized. If you want a reference on how to define an MDP in python you can take a look here:

## Course Objectives

After successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

- Relate reinforcement learning to (approximate) dynamic programming to solve MDPs
- Explain the role and purpose of neural networks in deep reinforcement learning
- Evaluate the different design choices to set up a reinforcement learning algorithm
- Benchmark the performance of reinforcement learning to other (near-)optimal solutions
- Acknowledge the limitations of reinforcement learning
- Apply reinforcement learning as a general purpose technology to a problem of choice

## Course Description

This course introduces the technique of reinforcement learning to optimize operations management problems. It covers both theoretical foundations as well as the implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms to practical problems. The focus will be on the effective application to operations management problems.

All students are expected to design and implement a reinforcement learning algorithm for a problem of choice. Examples of reinforcement learning applications in the operations management and logistics field are provided during the course. Coaching will be provided to assist the students in their assignment.

## Course Program

### Two Introductory Sessions (in Utrecht)
- Reinforcement learning and its relation to (approximate) dynamic programming
- The use of neural networks in reinforcement learning
- Design choices to set up a reinforcement learning algorithm and the different types of algorithms
- Definition of the problem that will be covered during the assignment
- How to get started?

### Regular Coaching Sessions
- Online coaching sessions per squad (e.g., bi-weekly)

### Closing Session (in Utrecht)
- Final presentations
- Closure of the program
- Debrief and discussion of future research opportunities

## Assignment

All students are expected to design and implement a reinforcement learning algorithm for an operations management problem of choice from their own research interests. The only requirement is that it involves sequential decision-making under uncertainty and that it can be modelled as a Markov Decision Process (the latter not being a strong restriction as we will see in this course).

The objective is to benchmark the performance of the (deep) reinforcement learning algorithm against existing heuristics and/or the optimal solution (possibly obtained through dynamic programming).

**Deliverables:**
- Presentation
- Final report (approx. 10 pages)

**Team Structure:**
- Students are teamed up in teams of two students based on their research interests
- Each team will be part of a squad of 2-4 teams
- Each squad will meet on a regular basis (e.g., bi-weekly) with their coach (one of the involved lecturers)

## Prerequisites

Students need to have:
- Solid background in probability theory and linear algebra
- Solid foundations with programming languages such as Python or C++
- Students can use their language of choice, but should ensure that the methods discussed in the sessions are available in their preferred language
- For neural networks, PyTorch and/or TensorFlow are recommended
- **No prior knowledge on machine learning is required**

## Course Materials

This repository contains:
- Course presentation materials
